# Lab-Grad
This is a typescript implemenation of a Pytorch-style autograd library, along with various tools for playing with the associated algorithms.

The underlying Autograd library, `packages/lab-grad-lib`, is directly inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's excellent "Micrograd" library](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).
